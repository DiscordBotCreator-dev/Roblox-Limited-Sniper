# Roblox Limited Sniper
Roblox Limited Sniper is a Sniper created by the user "lina#6543" On Discord This Program Was Coded In Python But Changed To EXE Using "auto-py-to-exe"

# features
- Premium And Standard, the premium and standard feature are 2 types you can use on the sniper, Standard is free yet Premium Costs 1 Month Of Discord Nitro
- Custom Limited, the custom limited feature is a feature only available on the standard type, i know that sounds weird, but the premium type makes you enter how much robux you want to spend, using that number it finds the best snipes possible.
- Premium, premium is a feature that you buy, you can tell if you read above this, the way premium works is if a premium user and standard user are trying to get the same limited, the code will stop the standard user from buying the item and will then let the premium user get the item, this code executes in 0.1 seconds so in the time the code executes you dont have to worry about a normal person buying it.
# requirements
- python installed (I use version 3.9.0). make sure to add to path when installing
- requests module. go to command prompt and type `pip install requests`
